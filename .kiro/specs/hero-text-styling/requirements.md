# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds styled text elements after the main hero heading "Build Your Team. Build Your Project." The text "Hire Vetted Software" and "Data Engineers" will be displayed in teal and green oval-shaped backgrounds respectively, with the "&" symbol between them having no background styling.
